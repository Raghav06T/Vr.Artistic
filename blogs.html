                    <p>Oil paint is still one of the most popular artistic mediums. 
                        Because of the wide expanse of colors, the ease of use, the layering ability, and the transportability of the medium, oil paints are here to stay</p>

                    <h2>Acrylic Paintings</h2>
                    <p>Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion and plasticizers, silicon oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps.
                        Most acrylic paints are water-based, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor, a gouache, or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media

                    <h2>Pen Work</h2>
                    <p>Pen drawing, artwork executed wholly or in part with pen and ink, usually on paper. 
                        Pen drawing is fundamentally a linear method of making images. A brown ink popular with the old masters because of its warm, luminous colour qualities was known as bistre.

                    <h2>Water Colour</h2>
                    <p>Watercolors are also often used by still life, landscape or portrait painters to create small-scale studies of complex paintings that they plan to do in a much larger scale later. 
                        Watercolor works well with colored pencil, watercolor pencils, graphite and ink for creating mixed media pieces.</p>

                    <h2>Pencil Work</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can use colored pencil to tint a drawing with light strokes that let the color of the paper show through, or you can use colored pencil to create a solid deposit of many layers of color. 
                        Because colored pencil is primarily a dry medium, there's no drying time to worry about.</p>

                <h2>Oil Pastel</h2>
                <p>An oil pastel is a painting and drawing medium formed into a stick which consists of pigment mixed with a binder mixture of non-drying oil and wax. 
                    In contrast to other pastel sticks which are made with a gum or methyl cellulose binder, and in contrast to wax crayons which are made without oil.</p>
